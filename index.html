		<p class="poem">
			That time of night, that lovely orange glow. A Streetlight can warm the soul, don't you know? Who reckoned that cold wires, metal, glass Could comfort one with a sight like hot brass? The lusty yearn of the flame mimicked there, This soft, sweet, and supple light comes to bear. The sun does not compare, it only blinds.

			Dandelion. A simple weed. A pest. An extraordinary wish that can make your dreams come true. It all depends on how you look at it.

		<p class="poem">
			Sunset is a pretty thing, so bathed in mystery, And yet it is the saddest thing, when drenched with memory, Sodden sunset soak the tears, That fall so endlessly, Silent sunset take my hand, and bring me down with thee.

		<p class="poem">
			The wigggle of an ear just as you near. A tilt of the head from something you said. Tail wagging - making a breeze a sure sign you really please. Jump up - turn around happy signs without a sound.
