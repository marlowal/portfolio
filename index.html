			That time of night, that lovely orange glow. 
A Streetlight can warm the soul, don't you know?
Who reckoned that cold wires, metal, glass
Could comfort one with a sight like hot brass?
The lusty yearn of the flame mimicked there,
This soft, sweet, and supple light comes to bear.
The sun does not compare, it only blinds.
